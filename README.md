## Overview

JaxBucket is a local-first, encrypted storage system built on [Iroh](https://iroh.computer/). It provides content-addressed, encrypted file storage with automatic peer-to-peer synchronization between authorized devices.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All files encrypted with ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **P2P Sync**: Automatic synchronization via Iroh's networking stack
- **Content-Addressed**: Files stored as immutable, hash-linked DAGs
- **Cryptographic Access Control**: ECDH + AES Key Wrap for secure multi-device access
- **Local-First**: Works offline, syncs when connected

## Downloads

Pre-built desktop binaries are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jax-protocol/jax-fs/releases) page:

| Platform | File | FUSE Mount Support |
|----------|------|--------------------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `Jax_*_aarch64.dmg` | No |
| macOS (Apple Silicon + FUSE) | `Jax_*_aarch64_fuse.dmg` | Yes (requires [macFUSE](https://osxfuse.github.io/)) |
| Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) | `jax-desktop_*_amd64.deb` | No |
| Linux (portable) | `jax-desktop_*_amd64.AppImage` | No |

The `_fuse` variant enables mounting buckets as local filesystem directories. See the [Installation Guide](agents/INSTALL.md) for details.
