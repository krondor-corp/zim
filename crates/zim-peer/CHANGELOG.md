## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-12

### Added
- Initial release
- CLI tool for JaxBucket
- Encrypted storage bucket management

## v0.1.17 (2026-03-29)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-2c3bbd919040a9f16971ddb74c0cd7eb4aed4a4a/> fix URL rewriting depth, add ?at= propagation and CSV rendering
   URL rewriting now handles arbitrarily deep relative paths (../../..) and
   bare relative paths (assets/2.png). Version-pinned browsing (?at=<hash>)
   is preserved across link clicks. CSV files are rendered as HTML tables
   with clickable links by default, with raw rewritten CSV via ?viewer=false.
 - <csr-id-d7eb43f96b1ed25ab54b563ddbe08ae6b8a035e5/> add bucket approve and ignore commands

## v0.1.16 (2026-03-21)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-9c8bcce6898c669f99db2de72afeda54f7d82555/> response cache + image transform
   * feat(gateway): add two-tier response cache and image transform
   
   Add a gateway response cache that eliminates repeated tree traversal,
   decryption, and image transformation on cache hit.
   
   Cache architecture:
   - Layer 1 (Path Index): SQLite-backed mapping of (bucket_id, height,
   path, transform_params) to content hash
   - Layer 2 (Content Store): BLAKE3-addressed blob store for
   decrypted/transformed content, naturally deduplicated
   - Background actor for periodic eviction (old heights, LRU, TTL)
   
   Image transform API via query params on existing gateway routes:
   - ?w=400 — resize to width (maintains aspect ratio)
   - ?w=400&h=300 — resize to exact dimensions
   - ?q=75 — output quality 1-100 (JPEG/WebP)
   - Supports JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
   - Caps dimensions at 4096px, validates params
   
   Cached/transformed responses include Cache-Control: public,
   max-age=31536000, immutable.

## v0.1.14 (2026-03-19)

<csr-id-54d05fe698640c1f957764519b690e029dbab700/>

### New Features

<csr-id-414cd21174e13a0614adab3f0c78757128bf1d94/>

 - <csr-id-bcfb790dca89b970bc8091f9a9093274932a57be/> bucket allowlist with approval, removal, and sync filtering
   * feat: add bucket allowlist with approval, removal, and sync filtering
* feat(gateway): add version endpoint for latest published bucket version

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-ab6b09f29f51f3a73c362e48e86e4c7e39e1fe71/> fix mv within mount and into mount
   Map MountError variants to proper errno values (ENOENT, EEXIST, EINVAL)
   instead of generic EIO. Accept and discard xattr writes (setxattr,
   removexattr reply ok) so macOS mv/cp -p don't fail when crossing
   filesystem boundaries into the FUSE mount.
   
   Closes JAX-8
 - <csr-id-56fece5340a6a1dda8afad8c651baa9f41d6591d/> prevent ping job queue saturation from blocking syncs
   Stale peer pings with ~30s connect timeouts were processed serially,
   starving sync/download jobs and flooding the bounded queue. This change:
   
   - Adds 5s timeout to ping operations (peer unavailability returns Ok)

### Other

 - <csr-id-54d05fe698640c1f957764519b690e029dbab700/> add fuse/no-fuse matrix to Rust CI and Linux FUSE release variant
   CI now tests both --all-features (FUSE) and --no-default-features (no FUSE)
   across quality, test, and build jobs. Release CLI gains a Linux x86_64 FUSE
   build. Build scripts accept CARGO_FEATURES env var to support the matrix.

## v0.1.13 (2026-03-19)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e71b5ac6767a27a4f11528368e72af83a13aab32/> shared CLI UI module with consistent formatting and --plain flag
   * feat: add shared CLI UI module with consistent formatting and --plain flag

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-9296b514cd72b81bb27530ffac4995bc7e062d73/> remove default Content-Type header that broke FUSE multipart uploads
   The ApiClient set a default Content-Type: application/json header, which
   caused multipart form uploads (used by FUSE flush to persist writes) to
   be sent as "application/json; boundary=..." instead of
   "multipart/form-data; boundary=...". Axum rejected these with "Invalid
   boundary", silently dropping all FUSE write persistence.
   
   Each build_request implementation already sets the correct Content-Type
   via reqwest's .json() or .multipart() methods.
 - <csr-id-219d4fa9c69fa0c1cd9a4c53bb2edd898577cab5/> persist FUSE mutations (unlink, mkdir, rename, create) via SaveRequest
   The FUSE filesystem was not sending SaveRequest after unlink, mkdir,
   rename, and create operations, causing those changes to be lost on
   remount. Only flush (writes) and setattr (truncate) were persisting.
   
   Extract a request_save() helper method and call it from all mutation
   handlers so every FUSE operation that modifies the mount tree is
   persisted consistently.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-ceb5cc9e512472c20cd60143467cbccc6a08ecd6/> route FUSE mutations through daemon HTTP API
   * refactor: route FUSE mutations through daemon HTTP API for persistence
   
   Replace the SaveRequest/save_tx channel mechanism with direct HTTP API
   calls to the daemon's endpoints. All FUSE mutations now persist via the
   same API that CLI and desktop clients use, ensuring a single source of
   truth for persistence.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-dceb2c8c9f8f5e2b6121cf9a118f7773d4da3fd7/> each crate captures its own CARGO_PKG_VERSION
   Previously, `jax version` reported 0.1.8 (common's version) instead of
   0.1.10 (daemon's version) because BuildInfo::new() in common captured
   CARGO_PKG_VERSION at common's compile time.
   
   Now daemon and desktop each have their own version module that captures
   the correct version from their own compile environment.

## v0.1.7 (2026-02-13)

### New Features (BREAKING)

<csr-id-a413ee6c2157ffec2f39a9b2df6ea389e3988df2/>

 - <csr-id-ec12a4b6731782a787a29c90a440417916c26157/> add FUSE filesystem for mounting buckets as local directories
   * feat!: add FUSE filesystem for mounting buckets as local directories
* feat!: restructure daemon, add Tauri desktop app with full UI
- Remove Askama HTML UI (replaced by Tauri desktop app)
- Split HTTP server into run_api (private) and run_gateway (public)
- Export start_service + ShutdownHandle for embedding
- Add bucket_log history queries with published field
- Replace --app-port/--gateway-port with --api-port/--gateway-port
- Tauri backend with direct ServiceState IPC (no HTTP proxying)
- SolidJS frontend: Explorer, Viewer, Editor, History, Settings pages
- File explorer with breadcrumbs, upload, mkdir, delete, rename, move
- File viewer for text, markdown, images, video, audio
- Version history with read-only browsing of past versions
- Settings: auto-launch toggle, theme switcher, local config display
- SharePanel for per-bucket peer sharing from Explorer
- System tray with Open, Status, Quit
- Tauri capabilities for dialog and autostart permissions
- Separate CI (ci-tauri.yml) and release (release-desktop.yml) workflows

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-76d456262a6fa4f16b4dfb6e7e120ac057bc47da/> use gateway URL for download button instead of localhost API
   The download button was using the localhost API URL which doesn't work
   for remote read-only nodes that don't expose the API over the internet.
   Now it uses the same gateway URL pattern as the share button, ensuring
   downloads work consistently across all node types.
